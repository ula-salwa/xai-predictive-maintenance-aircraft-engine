This thesis aims to analyze how explainable AI (XAI) can be implemented into predictive maintenance machine learning models to be able to identify which factors of aircraft components have the most significant impact on when a component will fail. Additionally, the thesis aims to analyze what impact a predictive maintenance strategy has on safety, efficiency, and costs.
1. The first sub-objective aims to critically describe the status and quality of current maintenance practices and strategies. Additionally, it aims to describe how machine learning models and XAI can be beneficial in maintenance strategies.
2. The second sub-objective aims to identify the most accurate type of machine learning model and how the implementation of XAI in these machine learning models makes models clearer and more understandable.
3. The third sub-objective aims to derive practical recommendations, address implementation challenges, and propose future research directions based on relevant emerging technologies.
