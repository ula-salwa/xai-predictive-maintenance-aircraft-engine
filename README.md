# Predictive Maintenance of Aircraft Components: Impact of Using XAI in ML Models on Costs, Safety, and Efficiency ✈️

## 📓 Overview
This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis at **Jacobs University Bremen**. It explores how **Explainable AI (XAI)** can enhance **predictive maintenance** models for aircraft components. The goal is to assess how model interpretability affects cost, safety, and operational efficiency in the aviation industry.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement predictive maintenance models for critical aircraft components.
- Apply XAI techniques to improve model interpretability and trust.
- Evaluate the impact of XAI on decision-making, focusing on maintenance costs, safety, and efficiency.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Methodology
1. **Literature Review:** Identifying shortcomings of traditional maintenance approaches, along with current technology practices.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transformation, and preparation of historical maintenance data and operational metrics.
3. **Model Development:** Building machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) to predict remaining useful life of component.
4. **Explainability Techniques:** Applying XAI techniques (SHAP and LIME) to make predictions interpretable, aiding maintenance decision-making.
5. **Evaluation:** Comparing model performance with and without XAI in terms of precision, recall, cost savings, and decision-making quality.

## 🚀 Key Results:
- Demonstrated that XAI-enhanced models provide transparent insights into predictions, helping engineers understand risk factors.
- Improved maintenance scheduling by accurately predicting component failures.
- Reduced unnecessary maintenance actions, saving on operational costs without compromising safety.

## 📂 Repository Structure:
- data/: Sample dataset for demonstration purposes.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with data processing, modeling, and XAI explanations.
- src/: Python scripts for model training, evaluation, and interpretability.
- results/: Outputs and visualizations highlighting the model's performance and interpretability insights.

## 🗝 Key Takeaway:
Using XAI in predictive maintenance not only enhances **model transparency** but also **supports critical decision-making** in the aviation sector by offering insights into how models determine risk factors and maintenance needs.
